# Final Project - Sorting Algorithm Analysis

This repository contains a Python implementation for analyzing the performance of three sorting algorithms. The project is developed as part of a **Final Examination** assignment for the Algorithms and Programming course.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To compare the **efficiency of sorting algorithms** in arranging smartphone sales data in **descending order** based on the number of units sold. The comparison is based on:

- Number of iterations
- Number of swaps

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Visual Studio Code / Jupyter Notebook
- (Optional) Matplotlib for visualization

## 📄 Description

The program includes the following steps:

1. Sales data is defined as a list of dictionaries.
2. The `hitung_total_per_brand()` function calculates the total sales for each smartphone brand.
3. The data is sorted using three algorithms:
   - `bubble_sort()`
   - `insertion_sort()`
   - `merge_sort()`
4. Each sorting function returns:
   - The sorted data
   - Total iterations
   - Total swaps

## 📊 Expected Output

The program prints the sorted list of smartphone sales from highest to lowest, along with detailed metrics such as:

- Number of iterations (comparisons made)
- Number of swaps during the sort

## 🔎 Notes

- The code is structured to be beginner-friendly and easy to read.
- You can extend it by adding runtime measurement or visualization using `matplotlib`.
